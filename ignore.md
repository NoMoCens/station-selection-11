# Automation Script for Getting Discord Server with a Tag

Since around May 6th, 2025, newly created Discord servers have a small, random chance (approximately 1 in 500) of including the experimental tag feature; this script automates the repetitive process of creating and deleting servers to help find one.

> [!NOTE]
> Successfully obtaining a server with this flag is only the first step; actually *using* the tag functionality requires boosting the server 3 times


Before running the script, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1.  **Disable 2FA**: The script needs 2FA disabled to automatically delete temporary servers without requiring confirmation prompts. Re-enable 2FA after you finish using the script.
2.  **Install Vencord**: This script relies on functions exposed by the Vencord client modification. Download and install it from the official source.
3.  **Enable Vencord Plugin**: Open Discord Settings, go to the Vencord "Plugins" tab, find and enable the `ConsoleShortcuts` plugin. This plugin exposes useful library functions (like `findByProps`) to the developer console, which are necessary for this script to work.
4.  **Restart Discord Client**: Close and reopen Discord completely to ensure Vencord and the plugin are loaded correctly.
5.  **Create One Server Manually (Required)**: Before running the script make sure to create a single server through the normal Discord interface first. It's a required step.

## Instructions

1.  **Open Developer Console**: Use the standard browser/Electron method to open the developer console (usually `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Option+I` on Mac, or sometimes F12).
2.  **Allow Pasting (If Prompted)**: The console might require you to explicitly type `allow pasting` before accepting pasted code. 
3.  **Paste and Run Code**: Copy the entire JavaScript code block below, paste it into the console, and press Enter.

**Remember to re-enable 2FA on your account once the script has found a server or you decide to stop it.**

### Troubleshooting

1. **Why do I get the `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'createGuildFromTemplate')` error?**  
   1.1. You need to manually create a new server before running the script; otherwise, the script won't be able to create a new server. If you ever need to run this script again, you'll need to repeat this step.

2. **Why do I get the `Uncaught ReferenceError: findByProps is not defined` error?**  
   2.1. You need to install **Vencord** and enable the **ConsoleShortcuts** plugin (not the **ConsoleJanitor** one!). After that, restart your client, manually create a server, and then run the script.
